# Project: 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

Welcome to the "0x04-more_functions_nested_loops" project! In this C programming project, we delve further into the concepts of functions and nested loops, building upon the foundation established in previous projects.

## Introduction

In this project, we continue our exploration of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. We will further refine our understanding of these concepts by tackling new challenges and solving problems using functions and nested loops.

The project includes a variety of C source files, each focusing on different aspects of functions and nested loops.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `0-isupper.c`: A function that checks for uppercase letters.
- `1-isdigit.c`: A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- `2-mul.c`: A function that multiplies two integers.
- `3-print_numbers.c`: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.
- `5-more_numbers.c`: A function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times.
- `6-print_line.c`: A function that draws a straight line using the `\` character.
- `7-print_diagonal.c`: A function that draws a diagonal line using the `\` character.
- `8-print_square.c`: A function that prints a square using the `#` character.
- `9-fizz_buzz.c`: A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz."

## Usage

To compile and run the C programs in this project, you can use a C compiler like `gcc`. For example:

```bash
gcc -o 0-isupper 0-isupper.c
./0-isupper
