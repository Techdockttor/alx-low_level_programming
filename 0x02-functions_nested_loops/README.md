# Project: 0x02-functions_nested_loops

# Introduction
# This is a C programming project that focuses on the concepts of functions and nested loops. It contains various C source files that demonstrate the usage of functions and nested loops to perform different tasks and solve problems.

# Project Structure

# The project is organized as follows:

# - `0-holberton.c`: A program that prints "Holberton" using `_putchar` function.
# - `1-alphabet.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using `_putchar` function and a loop.
# - `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times using nested loops.
# - `3-islower.c`: A function that checks if a character is lowercase.
# - `4-isalpha.c`: A function that checks if a character is an alphabetic character.
# - `5-sign.c`: A function that prints the sign of a number.
# - `6-abs.c`: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
# - `7-print_last_digit.c`: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
# - `8-24_hours.c`: A program that prints every minute of the day using nested loops.
# - `9-times_table.c`: A function that prints the 9 times table.
# - ...

# Usage

# To compile and run the C programs in this project, you can use a C compiler like `gcc`. For example:

# ```bash
# gcc -o 0-holberton 0-holberton.c _putchar.c
# ./0-holberton
# ```

# Make sure to replace the filenames and commands with the appropriate ones for the specific program you want to compile and run.

# Examples

# Here's an example of running the `0-holberton` program:

# ```bash
# $ gcc -o 0-holberton 0-holberton.c _putchar.c
# $ ./0-holberton
# Holberton
